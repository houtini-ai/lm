# Local LLM Test Analysis Report

## Issue Investigation: `analyze_project_structure` Failure

### Summary
The `analyze_project_structure` function failed initially with error:
```
"Error in analyze_project_structure: EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory, read"
```

### Root Cause Analysis

The error occurs in the MultiFileAnalysis.ts module when it tries to analyze an entire project directory that includes subdirectories like `node_modules`. Here's what happens:

1. **Directory Reading**: The function uses `fs.readdir(projectPath, { recursive: true })` to get all files
2. **File vs Directory**: The recursive option returns both files AND directories
3. **Failed Read Attempt**: When a directory path gets passed to `fs.readFile()`, it throws EISDIR error

### Code Location
- **File**: `src/core/MultiFileAnalysis.ts` (line 264-273)
- **Problem**: No check to verify if the path is a file before trying to read it
- **Called By**: `FileContextManager.analyseFile()` → `parseFile()` → `fs.readFile()`

### Testing Results

#### ✅ Successful Tests:
1. **Single file analysis**: Works perfectly
   - `analyze_code_structure` on individual files
   - Returns detailed analysis with architecture, dependencies, issues

2. **Source directory analysis**: Works when pointing to `src/` folder
   - Analysed 12 TypeScript files successfully
   - Generated proper statistics and architecture summary

3. **Simple test directory**: Works on controlled test directories
   - Created test with 2 JavaScript files
   - Analysis completed without errors

#### ❌ Failed Test:
- **Full project directory**: Fails when including `node_modules` or other complex structures
- Likely encounters thousands of files/directories causing the error

### The Fix Needed

The `analyzeProjectStructure` function needs to:

1. **Check if path is a file** before trying to read it:
```typescript
const stats = await fs.stat(filePath);
if (!stats.isFile()) continue;
```

2. **Skip problematic directories** like `node_modules`:
```typescript
if (filePath.includes('node_modules')) continue;
```

3. **Better error handling** for individual file failures:
```typescript
try {
  await manager.analyseFile(filePath);
} catch (err) {
  console.warn(`Skipping ${filePath}: ${err.message}`);
}
```

### Workaround for Now

Instead of analysing the entire project root, use specific subdirectories:
- ✅ `analyze_project_structure` on `src/` directory
- ✅ `analyze_project_structure` on `tests/` directory
- ❌ Avoid full project path with `node_modules`

### Performance Observations

- Analysing 12 files took ~566ms
- Token savings: 6000 tokens (vs reading all files directly)
- Cache works well for repeat analyses

## Conclusion

The local-llm MCP is functional and provides excellent token savings, but the `analyze_project_structure` function has a bug when dealing with directories. It attempts to read directories as files, causing the EISDIR error. 

**Best Practice**: Point it at specific source directories rather than entire project roots.
