### Parameter Optimization

**Getting Professional Results**:

**Use appropriate depth**:
- `"basic"` - Quick overview, large projects
- `"detailed"` - Standard professional analysis
- `"comprehensive"` - Mission-critical, showcase work

**Include context information**:
```json
{
  "context": {
    "framework": "React",
    "typescript": true,
    "focus": "security",
    "audience": "external_developers"
  }
}
```

**Specify constraints**:
```json
{
  "context": {
    "accessibility": "WCAG_2.1_AA",
    "browser_support": "modern",
    "performance": "mobile_first"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Connection Problems

**Symptom**: "Cannot connect to LM Studio"
**Diagnosis**:
```
Run detailed houtini-lm health check to identify the issue
```
**Solutions**:
1. Verify LM Studio is running at correct port
2. Check model is loaded and ready
3. Restart LM Studio if necessary
4. Verify firewall settings

### Performance Issues

**Symptom**: Functions running slowly
**Diagnosis**:
```
Check houtini-lm cache statistics for performance data
```
**Solutions**:
1. Clear analysis cache if memory usage high
2. Verify model is fully loaded (not still loading)
3. Use "basic" depth for large projects initially
4. Ensure adequate system memory (32GB recommended)

### Poor Output Quality

**Symptom**: Generic or low-quality analysis/generation
**Solutions**:
1. Increase `analysisDepth` to "comprehensive"
2. Add specific `context` information
3. Use larger model (13B+ parameters)
4. Include framework and technology details
5. Specify your exact requirements

### File Access Problems

**Symptom**: "Cannot access file" or permission errors
**Diagnosis**:
```
Use houtini-lm to analyze this path and suggest correct usage: C:/your/path
```
**Solutions**:
1. Use absolute paths only
2. Verify paths are within `LLM_MCP_ALLOWED_DIRS`
3. Check file and directory permissions
4. Ensure Desktop Commander MCP is installed

## Performance Optimization

### System Requirements for Best Results

**Recommended Hardware**:
- **CPU**: 8-core or better for local LLM processing
- **RAM**: 32GB (24GB for model, 8GB for development)
- **Storage**: SSD with 100GB+ free space
- **Model**: 13B+ parameters (Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct recommended)

**Configuration Optimization**:
- Keep LM Studio model loaded and ready
- Configure `LLM_MCP_ALLOWED_DIRS` appropriately
- Use SSD storage for model files
- Monitor memory usage during heavy analysis

### Token Efficiency Strategies

**Smart Function Selection**:
- Use analysis functions to understand problems
- Use generation functions to create solutions
- Reserve Claude for strategic thinking
- Combine multiple houtini-lm operations before consulting Claude

**Batch Operations**:
```
1. Use houtini-lm for multiple file analysis in sequence
2. Use houtini-lm for multiple generation tasks
3. Single Claude consultation for strategic overview
4. More houtini-lm operations based on strategy
```
