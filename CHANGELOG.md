## [4.1.0] - 2025-08-29

### ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR RELEASE - 3-Stage Architecture Complete

### Added
- **Complete 3-Stage Architecture Deployment** - All multifile plugins now use the proven 3-stage prompt architecture
  - `ThreeStagePromptManager` integration across all 4 multifile plugins
  - `getPromptStages()` method with structured prompt stages (System+Context, Data Payload, Output Instructions)
  - `executeSinglePass()` and `executeWithChunking()` methods for intelligent operation sizing
  - Dynamic context detection from LM Studio (23,832 tokens from Qwen 3 Coder 30B)

### Changed  
- **Architecture Consistency** - Eliminated dual chunking conflicts throughout codebase
  - Context Window Manager is now the sole chunking authority
  - Single, consistent 3-stage chunking system across all multifile operations
  - Smart prompt staging for optimal LLM utilization
  - Consistent error handling and response formatting

### Fixed
- **100% Success Rate** - All multifile functions tested and verified working:
  - âœ… `compare_integration`: Perfect integration analysis with detailed findings
  - âœ… `trace_execution_path`: Successful 4-chunk processing with execution traces  
  - âœ… `diff_method_signatures`: Accurate signature compatibility analysis
  - âœ… `find_pattern_usage`: Pattern detection across entire codebase

### Performance
- **Context Preservation** - Eliminated hardcoded limits in favor of dynamic detection
