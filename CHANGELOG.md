# Changelog

## [2.11.1] - 2026-04-20

### Changed
- **Pre-flight estimator now uses ordinary-least-squares linear regression** over the most recent 100 `(prompt_tokens, TTFT_ms)` samples per model. Fits `TTFT ≈ α + β·prompt_tokens` so fixed per-request overhead (α) is separated from genuine per-token prefill cost (β). The previous ratio-of-averages estimator (`totalPromptTokens / totalTtftMs`) systematically under-predicted for inputs much larger than the historical mean because small-prompt TTFT is dominated by the α term. Verified against real data: a mixed-size sample set containing one 6,955-token call and six ≤230-token calls fits α=668ms, β=1.49ms/token (R²=0.999); predicts 7,000-token TTFT as 11.1s, matching the observed 11.0s within 1%. Falls back to the ratio estimator when fewer than 5 samples exist, then to a conservative default for unknown models.

### Added
- **`model_prefill_samples` SQLite table** — stores individual `(prompt_tokens, ttft_ms)` observations per model. Capped at 100 samples per model with oldest-first pruning on each insert. Written fire-and-forget alongside `model_performance` so a DB hiccup never stalls a tool response.
- **`fitPrefillLinear()`** in `model-cache.ts` — reusable OLS implementation exposed so the `shakedown.mjs` script and any future consumers can reason about prefill characteristics of the workstation.
- **Richer refuse diagnostic** — when `code_task_files` refuses a too-large input, the error message now shows whether the estimate came from the linear fit (with α, β, R², n) or the ratio fallback, so the caller can judge confidence in the refusal.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **`stats` MCP tool** — compact markdown dump of session + lifetime totals, per-model performance, and reasoning-token overhead. Optional `model` filter. Cheap to call repeatedly to watch the 💰 counter climb.
- **Lifetime performance persistence** — a new `model_performance` SQLite table accumulates calls, TTFT, tok/s, prompt tokens, completion tokens, and reasoning tokens across sessions. Footer now reads `this session: X · lifetime: Y`. `discover` shows both session and lifetime speed lines, with a `last used` date. Data lives in `~/.houtini-lm/model-cache.db` alongside the existing profile cache.
- **Backend detection** — startup probe distinguishes LM Studio (`/api/v0/models`), Ollama (`/api/tags`), and generic OpenAI-compatible (`/v1/models`). Surfaced in `discover` output. Inference stays on the portable `/v1/chat/completions` path regardless — detection only steers enrichment and the per-backend `reasoning_effort` mapping.
- **`delta.reasoning_content` capture** — LM Studio's "Separate reasoning_content" dev toggle, DeepSeek R1, and Nemotron stream reasoning via this vendor-extension field. Previously discarded → silent empty bodies when the model exhausted its output budget on reasoning. Now captured into a buffer and returned as a last-ditch fallback with a `reasoning-only` quality flag so the caller sees *something*.
- **Prefill keep-alive** — a timer fires `notifications/progress` every 10s while waiting for the first chunk, preventing the MCP client's ~60s request timeout from firing during long prompt processing on slow hardware with big inputs.
- **Split prefill vs mid-stream timeouts** — `PREFILL_TIMEOUT_MS` (180s) applies until the first chunk arrives; `READ_CHUNK_TIMEOUT_MS` (30s) takes over afterwards. New `PREFILL-STALL` quality flag when truncation happens before any chunk.
- **Pre-flight token estimator for `code_task_files`** — uses measured per-model prefill rate from SQLite to refuse obviously-over-budget inputs early with a concrete diagnostic (estimated prefill seconds, tokens, sample count) instead of letting them silently hang. Only fires after ≥2 measured samples — first-time callers are never refused.
- **Reasoning-token split in footer** — when `usage.completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens` arrives, the token block reads `prompt→total (reasoning / visible)`. Diagnoses "why is the body empty despite hit-max-tokens?" instantly.
- **`reasoning_effort` + `max_completion_tokens` in request body** — sent alongside `enable_thinking: false` and `max_tokens` for broader compatibility. `reasoning_effort` value is backend-mapped: `'none'` on LM Studio + Ollama (hardest off-switch), `'low'` on generic OpenAI-compatible.
- **`shakedown.mjs` end-to-end self-test** — runs all seven tools in sequence, prints a markdown summary with real TTFT / tok/s / token counts / reasoning-token split. Wired as `npm run shakedown`. Not shipped in the npm tarball.
- **`SHAKEDOWN.md`** — canonical natural-language test prompt for conversational test runs via Claude.
- **`DEVELOPER.md`** — internals guide: streaming pipeline, reasoning-model handling, backend detection, SQLite schema, pre-flight estimator, adding tools/backends, release process, quality-flag reference.

### Fixed
- **`reasoning_effort: 'low'` caused HTTP 400 on Nemotron via LM Studio** — the LM Studio adapter accepts `none | minimal | low | medium | high | xhigh`, and Nemotron's narrower set would reject `'low'` with a silent fallback to `'on'` (maximum reasoning — opposite of intent). Backend-mapped value (`'none'` on LM Studio) is accepted by every model variant and is the hardest off-switch available.
- **Silent empty bodies on reasoning models** (Nemotron, DeepSeek R1, LM Studio with "Separate reasoning_content") — previously `delta.reasoning_content` was tracked for progress notifications but never accumulated into a content buffer, so when the model exhausted `max_tokens` on reasoning before emitting any `delta.content`, the response was empty and no safety flag fired. Now captured and returned via `reasoningFallback` with a clear preamble and flag.
- **Thinking-model detection was Gemma-4-only** — now covers Nemotron, DeepSeek R1, GLM-4, gpt-oss, and `qwen3-thinking` / `*-thinking` patterns. Arch + id + HF chat_template signals are OR'd.
- **Stale cache masked new thinking detection** — `getThinkingSupport` now re-applies the arch/id fallback at read time, so entries cached before the detection list was broadened still pick up flags without a manual cache flush.
- **`max_tokens` inflation used wrong base** — was `DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS` (16k), now `effectiveMaxTokens` (context-aware 25%), so inflation sizes correctly on big-context models.
- **README `code_task_files` parameter name** — was documented as `file_paths`, actual parameter is `paths`.

### Changed
- **Footer format updated** to show `this session: X · lifetime: Y` and `tokens (reasoning / visible)` splits where applicable.
- **`discover` per-model speed line** now shows session and/or lifetime variants; the "not yet benchmarked" fallback only appears for models with no prior use on the workstation.
- **`code_task_files` tool description** mentions the size ceiling and pre-flight estimator behaviour.
- **`.gitignore` / `.npmignore`** add explicit `memory/` and `MEMORY.md` entries.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-04-20

### Changed
- **Tool descriptions reframed from pitch to peer** — removed "FREE, parallel worker", "delegate generously — it costs nothing", and similar salesy framing from `chat`, `custom_prompt`, `code_task`, and `code_task_files`. Descriptions now state the honest trade (local inference is typically 3-30× slower than frontier models, but doesn't bill against the user's Claude quota) and let the caller decide task-by-task. Positions houtini-lm as a sidekick — a capable peer for bounded work — rather than a blanket offload target.
- **Session savings line promoted** — the cumulative offloaded-token line now appears on its own line below the response footer with a 💰 prefix and "Claude quota saved this session" framing, instead of being pipe-separated among six other fields. Reads as value rather than accounting.
- **`discover` connection latency relabelled** — the ms number in discover is now labelled "Connection latency (does not reflect inference speed)" to avoid the prior misreading that it measured how fast the model generates tokens.

### Added
- **Session-level sidekick instructions** — the MCP `Server` now sends an `instructions` string at initialisation that frames houtini-lm as a local LLM sidekick, states when to delegate vs when not to, and directs Claude to `discover` for model speed. Surfaced once per session by the MCP client, so it sets baseline expectations rather than relying on per-tool descriptions being re-read.
- **First-call speed benchmark** — on the first measured call per model per session, the response footer adds a prominent line (`📊 First measured call on <model>: X tok/s, Yms to first token`). No synthetic warmup — the number reflects a real task. Gives Claude honest speed data for calibrating subsequent delegation decisions.
- **`discover` surfaces measured speed** — the active model's measured tok/s and TTFT appear prominently near the top of the discover output, averaged over the session. Shows "not yet benchmarked" when no real call has run, rather than inventing a number from an artificial probe.

### Fixed
- **Streaming reader cleanup on abrupt disconnect** — the `finally` block now races `reader.cancel()` against a 500ms timer before `releaseLock()`, so abrupt client disconnects free the upstream socket sooner without blocking the tool response path. Previously `releaseLock()` alone could leave a wedged upstream connection until the per-chunk timeout fired.
- **Average TTFT denominator** — per-model `avgTtftMs` (in `discover`, the `houtini://metrics/session` resource, and the session performance block) now divides `totalTtftMs` by a dedicated `ttftCalls` counter rather than `calls`. Previously, calls that reported no TTFT still counted toward the divisor, under-reporting the average. Surfaced by the new prominent speed line in `discover`.
- **Footer no longer swallows session line when `parts` is empty** — if every other footer field is absent but the session savings line or first-call benchmark exists, the footer now renders those instead of returning an empty string.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **`code_task_files` tool** (#4) — accepts absolute file paths; the server reads and concatenates them server-side so source never passes through the MCP client's context window. Uses `Promise.allSettled` so one unreadable file doesn't sink the call; failures are surfaced inline.
- **Dynamic `max_tokens`** (#5) — derived from the active model's loaded context window (25%, e.g. 262K ctx → 65K output) when the caller doesn't pass an explicit budget. Falls back to 16384 when context is unknown.
- **Progress notifications during reasoning** (#5) — each streamed chunk sends a progress notification during the thinking phase too, resetting the client's 60s clock so big-input + slow-TTFT calls don't time out.
- **Thinking-model detection for gated HuggingFace repos** — including Gemma 4.

### Fixed
- **Empty response body from thinking models** (#6) — two-layer fix:
  1. For models that support thinking toggle, inflate `max_tokens` by 4× (minimum +2000) so reasoning doesn't starve content generation. Gemma 4 hardcodes `enable_thinking=true` in its Jinja template and ignores the API flag, so this inflation is the real fix.
  2. Safety net: if the `<think>` stripper still ends up with an empty `cleanContent` (MLX/GGUF quants that ignore the flag entirely), return the raw output with a `think-strip-empty` quality flag instead of an empty body + lone footer.
- **Default soft timeout** raised to 5 minutes — progress notifications reset the MCP client's 60s clock, so the soft timeout is now a safety net rather than the primary limit.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Quality metadata** — every response includes structured quality signals (truncation, think-block detection, token estimation, finish reason) so Claude can make informed trust decisions about local LLM output
- **Session metrics resource** — `houtini://metrics/session` MCP resource exposes cumulative offload stats and per-model performance as JSON, enabling proactive routing feedback
- **Request semaphore** — inference calls are serialised to prevent stacked timeouts when parallel requests hit a single-model server

### Fixed
- **SQLite statement leak** in `getCachedProfile` — statement was not freed if `getAsObject()` threw (now wrapped in try/finally)
- **Unflushed SSE buffer** — the final streaming chunk (often containing usage data) could be stranded in the buffer after loop exit, causing missing token counts on truncated responses
- **Session stats on truncated responses** — token counts now estimated from content length (~4 chars/token) when the usage chunk is lost, instead of silently showing zero

## [2.7.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Model routing** — automatically picks the best loaded model for each task type (code, chat, analysis, embedding)
- **Per-model prompt hints** — temperature, output constraints, and think-block flags tuned per model family (GLM, Qwen, LLaMA, Nemotron, Granite, GPT-OSS)
- **`stream_options: { include_usage: true }`** — enables accurate tok/s measurement from SSE streams
- Model routing suggestions when a better model is downloaded but not loaded

### Changed
- `code_task` temperature now set by routing hints (e.g. 0.1 for Qwen Coder) instead of hardcoded 0.2
- `chat` and `custom_prompt` inject output constraints into system prompts for models that need them
- Perf averaging now divides by calls with actual data, not all calls
- `profileModelsAtStartup` batches DB writes (single flush instead of per-model)
- Removed unused `dirname` import from model-cache.ts
- Test suite auto-detects loaded model instead of hardcoding

### Fixed
- tok/s was always `?` because `stream_options` wasn't set
- Perf averages inflated by calls without usage data

## [2.6.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Model discovery** — loaded vs available models, context window reporting, capability profiles
- **SQLite cache** (sql.js, pure WASM) — auto-profiles models via HuggingFace API, 7-day TTL
- **Performance stats** — TTFT and tok/s measured from SSE stream timing
- **Structured output** — `json_schema` parameter for grammar-constrained JSON
- **Embeddings tool** — `/v1/embeddings` endpoint support
- **Think-block stripping** — removes `<think>` blocks from GLM, Nemotron, Qwen3
- **12 static model profiles** — Nemotron, Granite, Qwen3, LLaMA, GLM-4, GPT-OSS, and more
- Session-level token accounting across all calls
