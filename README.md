## Context Window Management

Houtini LM implements intelligent context window management to maximize the efficiency of your local LM models while ensuring reliable processing of large files and complex analysis tasks.

### Dynamic Context Allocation

**Adaptive Context Utilization**: Unlike systems with hardcoded token limits, Houtini LM dynamically detects your model's context window and allocates **95% of available tokens** for optimal performance:

```typescript
// Context detection from your loaded model
const contextLength = await model.getContextLength(); // e.g., 16,384 tokens

// Dynamic allocation - 95% utilization
const responseTokens = Math.floor(contextLength * 0.95); // 15,565 tokens available
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Maximum efficiency** - No wasted context space
- ✅ **Model-agnostic** - Works with any context size (4K, 16K, 32K+)
- ✅ **Future-proof** - Automatically adapts to larger models

### Three-Stage Prompt System

Houtini LM uses a sophisticated prompt architecture that separates concerns for optimal token management:

**Stage 1: System Context** - Expert persona and analysis methodology  
**Stage 2: Data Payload** - Your code, files, or project content  
**Stage 3: Output Instructions** - Structured response requirements  

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   System Context   │  ← Expert role, methodologies
├─────────────────────┤
│   Data Payload     │  ← Your files/code (chunked if needed)
├─────────────────────┤
│ Output Instructions │  ← Response format, requirements
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Intelligent Processing:**
- **Small files** → Single-stage execution for speed
- **Large files** → Automatic chunking with coherent aggregation
- **Multi-file projects** → Optimized batch processing

### Automatic Chunking Capability

When files exceed available context space, Houtini LM automatically chunks content while maintaining analysis quality:

**Smart Chunking Features:**
- 🔍 **Natural boundaries** - Splits at logical sections, not arbitrary points
- 🔄 **Context preservation** - Maintains analysis continuity across chunks
- 📊 **Intelligent aggregation** - Combines chunk results into coherent reports
- ⚡ **Performance optimization** - Parallel processing where possible

**Example Chunking Process:**
```
Large File (50KB) → Context Analysis → Exceeds Limit
    ↓
Split into 3 logical chunks → Process each chunk → Aggregate results
    ↓
Single comprehensive analysis report
```

### Timeout Configuration

Houtini LM uses **120-second timeouts** (2 minutes) to accommodate thorough analysis on lower-powered systems:

**Why Extended Timeouts:**
- 🔍 **Complex analysis** - Security audits, architecture analysis, and comprehensive code reviews take time
- 💻 **System compatibility** - Works reliably on older hardware and resource-constrained environments  
- 🧠 **Model processing** - Larger local models (13B-33B parameters) require more inference time
- 📊 **Quality over speed** - Comprehensive reports are worth the wait

**Timeout Guidelines:**
- **Simple analysis** (100 lines): 15-30 seconds
- **Medium files** (500 lines): 30-60 seconds  
- **Large files** (1000+ lines): 60-120 seconds
- **Multi-file projects**: 90-180 seconds

**Performance Tips:**
- Use faster models (13B vs 33B) for quicker responses
- Enable GPU acceleration in LM Studio for better performance
- Consider using `analysisDepth="basic"` for faster results when appropriate

### Memory Efficiency

**Intelligent Caching**: Results are cached to prevent redundant processing  
**Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of large contexts after processing  
**Streaming Responses**: Progressive output delivery for better user experience

This architecture ensures Houtini LM can handle everything from small utility functions to entire enterprise codebases while maintaining consistent quality and performance across different hardware configurations.
